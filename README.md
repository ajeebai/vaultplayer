## 🤔 Why Is It Cool?

I made this project to view a large library of folders and subfolders of my movies and tv-series in one netflix like experience.

Here's what makes Vault special:

*   **💻 Truly Offline & Private:** Scan any local folder, and Vault builds a library. No internet? No problem. Your media stays on your machine, always, refreshing browser cache or cookies will reset the app!

*   **🎬 Smart & Beautiful UI:** Automatically generates posters, organizes your media, and remembers where you left off. It’s like having your own personal Netflix, but for your files.

*   **📁 Drag, Drop, Done:** No complicated setup, no servers to manage. Just drag a folder onto the screen, and Vault handles the rest. It’s that simple.

*   **🎨 Customizable Themes:** Not a fan of the default look? Switch between a classic dark theme, a retro CRT vibe, or a dreamy light mode to match your mood.

## 💡 Use Cases

Vault is perfect for...

*   🔒 **The Privacy-Conscious:** Enjoy your media without being tracked or having your viewing habits analyzed by a big corporation.
