## 🤔 Why Is It Cool?

Here's what makes Vault special:

*   **💻 Truly Offline & Private:** Scan any local folder, and Vault builds a library. No internet? No problem. Your media stays on your machine, always. We don't track you, upload your files, or phone home.
*   **🎬 Smart & Beautiful UI:** Automatically generates posters, organizes your media, and remembers where you left off. It’s like having your own personal Netflix, but for your files.
*   **📁 Drag, Drop, Done:** No complicated setup, no servers to manage. Just drag a folder onto the screen, and Vault handles the rest. It’s that simple.
*   **🎨 Customizable Themes:** Not a fan of the default look? Switch between a classic dark theme, a retro CRT vibe, or a dreamy light mode to match your mood.

## 💡 Use Cases

Vault is perfect for...

*   ✈️ **The Traveler:** Load up your laptop with movies and enjoy your entire collection on a long flight, with a great UI and no Wi-Fi needed.
*   👨‍👩‍👧 **The Family:** Create a safe, kid-friendly media library on a home computer without exposing them to the wider internet.
*   🔒 **The Privacy-Conscious:** Enjoy your media without being tracked or having your viewing habits analyzed by a big corporation.
*   💾 **The Archivist:** Organize and browse your collection of old home videos, documentaries, or recorded lectures in a visually appealing way.

## 🛠️ Quick Start Guide

Ready to build your own vault? Get it running locally in under a minute.

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vault.git
    cd vault
    ```

2.  **Start a local server:**
    This project uses modern browser features and needs to be served, not just opened as a file. The easiest way is with `serve`.
    ```bash
    npx serve
    ```

And that's it! Your personal streaming vault is now running. Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided by `serve`.
